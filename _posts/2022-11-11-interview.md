Q. What has never made sense to you?

I once walked past a man with an impossibly beautiful girlfriend. At the instant our paths crossed, he said to her, "Um, so did you know, babies aren't born with knees?" She said nothing and kept holding his hand. People can really love like that.

Q. What do you think of the Blue Satchel Raid?



Q. What do you think of the Iron Girls?



Q. Thoughts on the U.S. progressive movement?

A. They may have rejected Marxism because it doesn't provide enough moral denunciation for them. 

Q. What are your hopes for humanity?

A. You don't throw anything at me. I don't throw anything at you. We never say anything that we will remember for years.
