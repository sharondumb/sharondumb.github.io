I am Sharon Du. I was born in Takapuna, New Zealand, and my family is from Haining, China. I was largely raised in Melbourne, Australia.

In 2022, I graduated with a B.A.H. in International Relations from Stanford University. I am currently a J.D. candidate at Yale Law School.

I am a product of late 2000s internet forums, state propaganda, and anonymous question-asking websites.
